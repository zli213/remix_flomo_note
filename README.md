# Remix flomo notes app

## Project Overview

**Remix flomo notes app** is a full-stack application developed using the Remix framework. It serves as a Tech Demo project for learning and implementing the Remix framework, which is a personal assignment of COMPSCI 732. The goal of this project is to create a note-taking software similar to flomo(<https://flomoapp.com/>). This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for developers, covering the setup process, project structure, and necessary configurations. Due to the original is part of github classroom, the original repo is private. Now I have made it public. I hope this project can help you learn Remix.

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
